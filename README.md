# EduHub

An open-source educational platform that provides access to a wide range of courses and learning materials. EduHub should support features like user profiles, course creation, progress tracking, quizzes, andÂ discussions.

## Environment Files

- Every project has some special content that is not displayed to public. These "secrets" are usually placed inside the environment file of the project.
- Since backend and frontend of a project are supposed to be loosely coupled projects, both of them have their own environment file as described below.

### Frontend Environment

Create a `.env` file in the frontend root folder and add following variables with there corresponding appropriate values

```bash
```

### Backend Environment

Create a `.env` file in the backend root folder and add following variables with there corresponding appropriate values

```bash
MONGODB_URL="<mongodb-database-connection-url-here>"
PORT=<port-on-which-the-backend-runs>
JWT_SECRET="<secret-string-used-to-sign-the-authentication-tokens-used-for-logged-in-users>"
FRONTEND_URL="<url-of-the-frontend-which-requires-cors-access-once-deployed>"
```
